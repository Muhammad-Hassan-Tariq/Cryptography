# 🔐 Cryptography Lab — From Classical Ciphers to Modern Crypto

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Cryptography Lab** — a curated collection of 🔒 cryptographic algorithms, all implemented from scratch in **C++** by me (a 3rd-semester CS undergrad 🤓).  

No black-box libraries. No shortcuts. Just raw, hands-on cryptography.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This repo is basically a **mini lab for learning & exploring Cryptography** — from RSA to hashing, AES, and digital signatures.

### ⚔️ Modern Cipher Frameworks/ Helper Algorithms
- ✅ Fiestel Cipher/ Network
- ✅ Advance Encryption Standard (AES)  

### 🔐 Public-Key Cryptography
- ✅ RSA (Key Generation + Encryption/Decryption)  
- ✅ Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange  

### ✍️ Digital Signatures & Certificates
- ✅ Basic Digital Signature Demo  
- ✅ Simple Digital Certificate Generator  

### #️⃣ Hashing Algorithms
- ✅ Custom Demo Hash Function  
- ✅ SHA Family Implementation *(planned/in-progress)*  
- ✅ Hash Collisions / Rainbow Table Exploration *(experimental)*

## 🔄 Putting It All Together

This repo isn't just isolated demos — the goal is to show how these cryptographic tools work **in harmony**.  
🔐 Encryption + Hashing + Signing + Key Exchange — this is how modern security systems are built.

Future updates will include practical flows showing how these techniques combine in **real-world systems** (e.g., secure messaging, authentication protocols, hybrid encryption models, etc.).

## 💡 Why I Made This

As a **Cybersecurity enthusiast**, I wanted a single place to:
- Learn crypto by building it  
- Understand how real encryption works behind the scenes  
- See how systems are built (and how they break 👀)

This repo is my way of going beyond just reading about algorithms — I coded them.  
Whether you're a student, a dev, or just crypto-curious — this lab will help you **truly understand** the magic behind cryptography 💥
