# 🔐 Cryptography Lab — Classical to Modern Crypto, All in One Repo

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Cryptography Lab** — a curated collection of 🔒 cryptographic algorithms implemented from scratch in **C++** and other languages (as I go). Whether you're learning crypto basics or flexing your cyber muscles, this repo has your back 💪

## 📚 What's in This Lab?

This repo is basically a **toolkit for understanding core concepts of Cryptography** — from ancient Caesar shifts to modern-day RSA and digital signatures.

### 🏛 Classical Ciphers
- ✅ Caesar Cipher
- ✅ Vigenère Cipher
- ✅ Transposition Cipher
- ✅ Hill Cipher
- ✅ Playfair Cipher *(maybe add later)*

### 🔐 Public-Key Cryptography
- ✅ RSA Encryption/Decryption
- ✅ Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- 🔜 ElGamal Cryptosystem *(planned)*

### ✍️ Digital Signatures & Certificates
- ✅ Simple Signature Demo
- ✅ Certificate Generation Basics *(in progress)*

### 🔑 Key Exchange Protocols
- ✅ Diffie-Hellman (again, because it slaps)
- 🔜 ECC-based exchange *(future work)*

### #️⃣ Hashing Algorithms
- ✅ Simple Hashing (custom demo)
- 🔜 SHA Family Implementation
- 🔜 Hash collision exploration / rainbow tables (maybe 😉)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

As a **Cybersecurity enthusiast**, I wanted a place where everything cryptographic lives — raw, minimal, and easy to grasp. No black-box libraries, no hand-waving.  
Just **you + code + math + logic** = 🔥

Whether you're a student, hacker, or crypto-curious dev, this repo will help you understand:
- How crypto **actually works behind the scenes**
- How to **implement it yourself**
- How to **break & defend** systems better (ethically, of course 😎)
